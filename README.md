## 💻 Assignments

### Assignment 1: Basics

- Implement all of the components (tokenizer, model architecture, optimizer) necessary to train a standard Transformer language model
- Train a minimal language model



### Assignment 2: Systems

- Profile and benchmark the model and layers from Assignment 1 using advanced tools, optimize Attention with your own Triton implementation of FlashAttention2

- Build a memory-efficient, distributed version of the Assignment 1 model training code





### Assignment 3: Scaling

- Understand the function of each component of the Transformer
- Query a training API to fit a scaling law to project model scaling



### Assignment 4: Data

- Convert raw Common Crawl dumps into usable pretraining data
- Perform filtering and deduplication to improve model performance



### Assignment 5: Alignment

- Apply supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning to train LMs to reason when solving math problems
- **[Optional Part 2](https://github.com/stanford-cs336/assignment5-alignment/blob/main/cs336_spring2025_assignment5_supplement_safety_rlhf.pdf)**: implement and apply safety alignment methods such as DPO
